    <p>Hi ya'll my name is Caleb Pettingill! I know we've already gone aroung the room to introduce ourselves but if ya don't remember, I'm from Los Angeles California and I really enjoy anime. I love reading fantasy also, I like to dabble in romance. I'm here at BYUI more or less to meet people my age with the fun extra part of my goal being getting an education here.</p>
